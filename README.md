**Stability Definition**
 - The definition of stability for the hospital-residents matching problem is
when a resident doesn't prefer a hospital more than it's assigned hospital,
or if it does, that hospital doesn't prefer that resident over it's assigned
residents
 - If the opposite happens, that creates a *blocking pair* which leads to an unstable matching
